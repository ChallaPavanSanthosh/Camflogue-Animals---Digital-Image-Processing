# Camflogue-Animals---Digital-Image-Processing
Here are the key points from your project on camouflage in animals using digital image processing, explained in simple words:

### Project Overview
The project involves using digital image processing to analyze and quantify camouflage in animals.
It uses various techniques such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and edge-intersecting cluster count to measure the effectiveness of camouflage.

### Methodology
- Here's what I made:
  1. **Gather Images**: We collected pictures of animals and their backgrounds.
  2. **Label Images**: We added labels to the pictures to help the computer understand what it's looking at.
  3. **Set Up Environment**: We prepared the necessary tools and software for the project.
  4. **Train and Test**: We used 80% of the images to train the computer and 20% to test its accuracy.
  5. **Create Model**: We designed a model using TensorFlow and Keras to analyze the images.
  6. **Compile Model**: We set up the model to use a specific algorithm to optimize its performance.
  7. **Train Model**: We trained the model using the labeled images.
  8. **Run Model**: We ran the model to see how well it could predict the accuracy.

### Results
- Our model was able to accurately predict the camouflage effectiveness with an accuracy of 80%.
